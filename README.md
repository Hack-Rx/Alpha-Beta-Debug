# Alpha-Beta-Debug

We are building a mobile application which has following features:

1. It provides an interactive chat option where the user can input his/her symptoms and get diagnosed for most disease or discomfort that they might be facing. It will also determine the possibility of COVID-19 and will help in avoiding placebo situations.

2. If the possibility of COVID-19 is above the threshold, then the user would be recommended to isolate themselves. While their symptoms would be tracked for next 15 days.

3. An interface to test stress levels so that we can avoid unnecessary cases of placebo.

# How we measure stress??

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in oneâ€™s life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress.


# What we can add next?

1. Hospital tracking system
2. AI Integration to diagnose diseases.
3. Stress-relief using calming audio files.
